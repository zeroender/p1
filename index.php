      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Hi there!  I'm a native of Boston, Massachussets.
      I live on the North shore with my wife Kara and daughter Amelia.
      I'm currently employed at Oracle, Inc, where I work as a Quality Engineer,

      I started learning about web development about 2 years ago,
